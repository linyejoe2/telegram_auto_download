# ChangeLog

## 1.0.0.0807 Code Architecture Refactoring and Interactive Folder Navigation

### feature

+ **Interactive Folder Navigation System** - New folder selection interface for organized downloads
  + Add `src/folder_navigator.py` - Complete folder navigation and management system
  + Interactive commands: `/cr folder_name` (create), `/cd folder_name` (navigate), `/cd..` (back), `/ok` (confirm)
  + Real-time folder structure display with breadcrumb navigation
  + User session management with pending message tracking
  + Smart folder creation and validation with path safety checks
  + Media type statistics display during folder selection

+ **Enhanced User Experience** - Step-by-step folder selection workflow
  + Users can organize downloads into custom folder structures before downloading
  + Visual folder tree display with current location indication
  + Media preview showing file counts (photos, videos, documents) before folder selection
  + Confirmation system prevents accidental downloads to wrong locations

### refactor

+ **Major Bot Logic Simplification** - Streamlined message processing flow
  + Refactored complex nested processing into clean linear flow: command check → downloadable check → extract files → folder selection → download
  + Restructured `src/bot.py` with improved architecture (195 insertions, 166 deletions)
  + Eliminated duplicate code patterns and consolidated helper methods
  + Combined redundant processing paths into unified `_process_message()` workflow

+ **Code Architecture Improvements**
  + New helper methods: `_handle_commands()`, `_is_downloadable_message()`, `_extract_forward_info()`, `_extract_all_files()`, `_count_media_types()`
  + Unified download processing with `_process_confirmed_download()` replacing separate media group/single message methods
  + Centralized error message generation and forward info extraction
  + Simplified media group collection logic while maintaining all functionality

### improve

+ **Enhanced Code Maintainability**
  + Clear separation of concerns with single-responsibility methods
  + Linear execution flow eliminates complex branching logic
  + Better error handling with standardized message templates
  + Improved method naming for better code readability

+ **Database Protection** - Enhanced git workflow
  + Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude database files (`*.db`, `downloads.db`)
  + Prevents accidental tracking of user data and download history
  + Better project structure with protected sensitive files

### misc

+ Add `test_folder_navigation.py` - Testing framework for folder navigation system
+ Update `src/__init__.py` - Export folder navigator for modular access
+ All refactored code passes syntax validation and import tests
+ Preserved all existing functionality while adding new interactive features
+ Database integration and media group processing remain fully functional

## 0.4.0.0806-2329 Database Integration and Enhanced Management

### feature

+ **SQLite Database Integration** - Persistent storage for download history and metadata
  + Track all downloads with detailed metadata (message ID, file names, sizes, dates)
  + Duplicate detection to prevent re-downloading existing files
  + Download history queries and statistics
  + Automated database initialization and schema management

+ **Enhanced Download Management** - Improved file organization and tracking

## 0.3.1.0806-1730 Media Group Support

### feature

+ **Media Group Detection and Processing** - Intelligent handling of grouped media (albums)
  + Automatically detects messages with `media_group_id` from Bot API
  + Implements 2-second collection delay to ensure all grouped messages are captured
  + Smart collection mechanism with timer-based processing
  + Enhanced logging for media group collection progress

+ **Advanced Media Group Retrieval** - Multi-method approach for robust media group handling
  + Method 1: Direct `grouped_id` matching using Telethon API
  + Method 2: Range-based search around original message ID (±20 messages)
  + Method 3: Graceful fallback to original message processing
  + Handles Bot API and Telethon ID differences intelligently

+ **Enhanced Architecture** - Extended modular design for media group support
  + `_handle_media_group()` - Collects and manages grouped messages
  + `_process_media_group_delayed()` - Timer-based processing with async delay
  + `_process_grouped_messages()` - Dedicated media group download workflow
  + `_process_single_message()` - Refactored single message processing
  + `_download_and_monitor()` - Shared download and monitoring logic

+ **Smart Storage Organization** - Media group aware directory structure
  + Media groups stored in `mediagroup_{id}_{timestamp}` directories
  + Single messages continue using `message_{id}_{timestamp}` format
  + Preserves existing file naming conventions and organization

### improve

+ Enhanced bot architecture with clear separation of group vs single message processing
+ Improved error handling and logging for media group operations
+ Better resource management with shared download monitoring logic
+ More robust message collection with multiple detection methods

## 0.3.0.0806-1430 Major Architecture Refactoring

### refactor
