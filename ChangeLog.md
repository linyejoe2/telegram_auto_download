## 0.3.1.0806-1730 Media Group Support

### feature

+ **Media Group Detection and Processing** - Intelligent handling of grouped media (albums)
  + Automatically detects messages with `media_group_id` from Bot API
  + Implements 2-second collection delay to ensure all grouped messages are captured
  + Smart collection mechanism with timer-based processing
  + Enhanced logging for media group collection progress

+ **Advanced Media Group Retrieval** - Multi-method approach for robust media group handling
  + Method 1: Direct `grouped_id` matching using Telethon API
  + Method 2: Range-based search around original message ID (Â±20 messages)
  + Method 3: Graceful fallback to original message processing
  + Handles Bot API and Telethon ID differences intelligently

+ **Enhanced Architecture** - Extended modular design for media group support
  + `_handle_media_group()` - Collects and manages grouped messages
  + `_process_media_group_delayed()` - Timer-based processing with async delay
  + `_process_grouped_messages()` - Dedicated media group download workflow
  + `_process_single_message()` - Refactored single message processing
  + `_download_and_monitor()` - Shared download and monitoring logic

+ **Smart Storage Organization** - Media group aware directory structure
  + Media groups stored in `mediagroup_{id}_{timestamp}` directories
  + Single messages continue using `message_{id}_{timestamp}` format
  + Preserves existing file naming conventions and organization

### improve

+ Enhanced bot architecture with clear separation of group vs single message processing
+ Improved error handling and logging for media group operations
+ Better resource management with shared download monitoring logic
+ More robust message collection with multiple detection methods

## 0.3.0.0806-1430 Major Architecture Refactoring

### refactor

+ **Complete codebase restructure** - Split monolithic telegram_bot.py (596 lines) into modular architecture

  + Create `src/monitor.py` (134 lines) - Real-time monitoring and progress tracking
  + Create `src/__init__.py` - Package initialization and clean exports

+ **Separation of Concerns** - Each module has single responsibility
  + `TelegramMediaBot` class focuses on bot orchestration and user interaction
  + `MediaDownloader` class handles all download operations and file management
  + `DownloadMonitor` class manages real-time progress tracking and system monitoring

+ **Improved maintainability and testability**
  + Individual components can be tested independently
  + Clear interfaces between modules
  + Easier debugging and troubleshooting
  + Better code organization for future development

### feature

+ Add total file size display throughout download process
